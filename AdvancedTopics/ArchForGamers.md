# Arch Linux for Gamers

## Introduction
This document describes the setup and configuration of Arch Linux for gaming, including driver installation, performance optimization, and configuration of gaming platforms.

## Basic Setup

### GPU Drivers
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
```

### Gaming Environment
```bash
sudo pacman -S steam lutris wine
```

### Gaming Tools
```bash
sudo pacman -S gamemode
```

## Performance Optimization

### CPU Frequency
```bash
sudo pacman -S cpupower
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

### GPU Acceleration
```bash
sudo pacman -S mesa
```

### I/O Performance Boost
```bash
echo deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
```

## Gaming Platforms

### Steam
```bash
sudo pacman -S steam
```
- Proton is integrated directly in Steam
- No need for separate installation

### Lutris
```bash
sudo pacman -S lutris
```
- Wine is automatically downloaded with Lutris
- Supports various Wine versions

### Wine
```bash
sudo pacman -S wine
```
- Only if you need a standalone installation
- For most games, Proton or Wine in Lutris is sufficient

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound
```bash
sudo pacman -S alsa-utils
alsamixer
```

### Driver Issues
```bash
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
sudo pacman -S gamemode
```
